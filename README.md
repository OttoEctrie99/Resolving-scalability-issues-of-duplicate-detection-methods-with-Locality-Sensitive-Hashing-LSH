# Resolving-scalability-issues-of-duplicate-detection-methods-with-Locality-Sensitive-Hashing-LSH

The included R files provide the necessary code and functions to perform analysis on duplicate detection methods. 
More specifically, the Functions.R file contains all functions that are needed for cleaining data, extracting model words, perform minhasing and LSH and
compute evaluation metrics. 
The Bootstrap.R file is the main file where the full method is declared and executed. 
Both files are necessary for replication.
